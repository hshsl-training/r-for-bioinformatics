    "text": "What is Bioconductor?\nIn this lesson, we’ll be working with a number of bioinformatics packages along with the tidyverse family of packages. Many R packages come from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Packages from CRAN can be installed either by using the Install Packages widget in RStudio (lower-right pane) or with the function install.packages().\nBioconductor is an open-source project that provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput biological data, built on the R programming language. It includes a large ecosystem of packages for tasks such as sequence analysis, genomic data visualization, and statistical modeling in bioinformatics. Bioconductor emphasizes reproducibility, interoperability, and the integration of biological metadata, making it especially well-suited for omics research.\nTo use packages from Bioconductor, we must first install and load the Biocmanager package from CRAN. Biocmanager provides an interface to the Bioconductor repository.\n\nif (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n    install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n\nlibrary(BiocManager)\n\nNext, let’s install the packages we will be using in this session.
